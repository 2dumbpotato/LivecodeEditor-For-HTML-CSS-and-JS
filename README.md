# LivecodeEditor-For-HTML-CSS-and-JS
It is just a simple experiment for me learning to use JS and tailwind css


It uses simple javascript to work as codepen but with less effort and functionality.Tailwind is used for styling and was created using vite and node-modules have been ignored feel free to use it as you like and maybe improve it too .
